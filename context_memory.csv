*Overall:* Both companies face significant competition. Apple has higher valuation risk and supply chain vulnerability. Alphabet faces more antitrust regulatory risk.

**Clear Recommendation Comparison**

*   **Alphabet (GOOG):** **Buy** with a confidence level of 85%. Justification: Strong financial position, growth prospects, dominant market position, and relatively attractive valuation.
*   **Apple (AAPL):** **Hold** with a confidence level of 65%. Justification: Strong brand and ecosystem, but valuation is rich and growth is slowing. Better to wait for a more favorable entry point or signs of accelerated growth."
